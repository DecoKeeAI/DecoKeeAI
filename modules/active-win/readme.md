## API

### activeWindow(options?)

Get metadata about the active window.

#### options

Type: `object`

##### screenRecordingPermission **(macOS only)**

Type: `boolean`\
Default: `true`

Enable the screen recording permission check. Setting this to `false` will prevent the screen recording permission prompt on macOS versions 10.15 and newer. The `title` property in the result will always be set to an empty string.

### activeWindow.sync(options?)

Get metadata about the active window synchronously.

## Result

Returns a `Promise<object>` with the result, or `Promise<undefined>` if there is no active window or if the information is not available.

- `id` *(number)* - Window identifier
- `bounds` *(Object)* - Window position and size
	- `x` *(number)*
	- `y` *(number)*
	- `width` *(number)*

- `memoryUsage` *(number)* - Memory usage by the window owner process

### activeWindow.getOpenWindows()

Get metadata about all open windows.

Windows are returned in order from front to back.

Returns `Promise<activeWindow.Result[]>`.

### activeWindow.getOpenWindowsSync()

Get metadata about all open windows synchronously.

Windows are returned in order from front to back.

Returns `activeWindow.Result[]`.

## OS support

It works on macOS 10.14+, Linux, and Windows 7+.

**Note**: On Windows, there isn't a clear notion of a "Window ID". Instead it returns the memory address of the window "handle" in the `id` property. That "handle" is unique per window, so it can be used to identify them. [Read more…](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms632597(v=vs.85).aspx#window_handle)

### Linux support

Wayland is not supported. For security reasons, Wayland does not provide a way to identify the active window. [Read more…](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45465016)

## Electron usage

If you use this package in an Electron app that is sandboxed and you want to get the `.url` property, you need to add the [proper entitlements and usage description](https://github.com/sindresorhus/active-win/issues/99#issuecomment-870874546).
